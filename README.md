# C++ Overview
C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. It is an extension of the C programming language with additional features such as classes and objects, which support object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. C++ is known for its efficiency, performance, and flexibility, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including systems programming, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing, and more.
